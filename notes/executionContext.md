# Functions
The function is an abstract body and inside that body particular logic is written and that function expects some values which are known as parameters of the function. At the time of invoking the function we need to pass those values as an argument.

**Example of simple function**
```javascript=
// function accepting parameters
function ServeBeverage(drink, quantity){
    console.log('I want '+ quantity + " " + drink)
}
// calling function by passing arguments
serveBeverage('coffee',4) // print I want 4 coffee
```



## Ways of defining function in javascript
In JavaScript, we have multiple ways of defining functions.
### Traditional way of writing function
We can define functions in a way similar used in another programming language for function definition.
```javascript=

function sayHi(){
    console.log('mrinal says hi')
}
// calling function
sayHi()
```

### Function as Expressions(First class citizens)
We can write functions inside the variable in JavaScript. That's why it is known as first-class citizens.
**Example**
```javascript=
// Function as Expressions
let sayHi=function(){
    console.log('mrinal says hi')
}
// calling function
sayHi()
```


# Execution context in javascript

When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the Execution Context that handles the entire transformation and execution of the code.

During the context runtime, the parser parses the source code and allocates memory for the variables and functions. The source code is generated and gets executed.

There are two types of execution contexts: global and function. The global execution context is created when a JavaScript script first starts to run, and it represents the global scope in JavaScript. A function execution context is created whenever a function is called, representing the function's local scope.


- Now let's try to visualize this with taking in a code Example-




How the javascript code gets executed.

We have this code to Execute-


```javascript=
var a = 2
var b = 3
function add(num1, num2){
    var ans = num1+num2
    return ans;
}
var addition = add(4, 5)
console.log(addition) // print 9
add(addition, 4) 
let add1 = addition(a, b)
let add2 = addition(5, 6)
console.log(add1) // prints 5
console.log(add2) // prints 11
```

Javascript code executes in two phases:

1. **Memory Allocation:** Every particular variable is assigned with undefined value initially. Initially, no value is assigned to the variable, only memory is allocated. And every function will get its whole body in this phase.

2. **Code Execution:** Code will get executed in this phase. Now the values of variables are assigned. When the function is called and it starts executing then another memory allocation and the code block is created For every function calling. 
basically another execution context will be created for the function. And execution context of the whole program is known as the global execution context, and for a function it is called function's Execution Context
Variables declared inside the function are written inside the execution context of that particular function.


Execution context is created when the function is called and the answer is stored in the add1 variable.
![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/085/original/upload_1a31012a1e876a8f7c95aa73d0eef002.png?1695318823)

After completing the function execution, a particular function execution context returns the value and the job of it is done

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/086/original/upload_d3e7d682244f9386192f25604345466b.png?1695318849)


Now again execution context is created when the add() function is called again and the return value of the function is stored in add2.
![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/087/original/upload_5d5e478c9528b7fe00cc0b799debdc76.png?1695318906)

After the completion of function execution it gfain returns the value that was calculated

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/088/original/upload_80a8e7c9979b2c4b7e9a6129459cfeca.png?1695318933)

Now the execution of the program is completed and the whole execution context is now over and the final output is returned

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/089/original/upload_e27ec9b99f9a4fc64569b634d07f2a30.png?1695318988)


**Execution context for the below code**

```javascript=
var n = 3
function square(num){
    var ans = num*num
    return ans
}
let square1 = square(n)
```

- Firstly global execution context will be created.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/090/original/upload_4af9552ee646a0fe31bae98443b75adf.png?1695319026)

- Then the value to the n will be assigned.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/091/original/upload_bdeb77ccd5eed38c0a9afe636098474e.png?1695319049)

- Now execution context is created for the square method as it is called.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/092/original/upload_e409b43de48b1647ec498a5bb8cd358c.png?1695319076)

- Variables declared inside the function are initialized by undefined values in the function execution context.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/093/original/upload_4ee9ea62766996fd53d0645bd52785b3.png?1695319103)

- Now the value will be assigned to the variables of the function execution context.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/094/original/upload_30b10d1997acbd7260a784b6f639b4c2.png?1695319173)

- After that function execution context returns value to the global execution context and the function execution context is not required further.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/095/original/upload_2c00f2a7212c3e93e02fa480dcf396c1.png?1695319197)

- Now the program is executed completely and global execution returns the final output

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/096/original/upload_fe64e69af8a31efb89e43340574b7b9d.png?1695319220)



# Hoisting.

```javascript=
var a = 4

function printName(){
    console.log('my name is mrinal')
}
console.log(a)
printName()
```



**Output**
```
4
my name is mrinal
```

Perfectly Fine Output as you will expect of the above code

Now consider this code-

```javascript=

console.log(a) // trying to execute it at the top

printName() // trying to execute this at the top

var a = 4

function printName(){
    console.log('my name is mrinal')
}

```


**Output**
```plaintext
undefined
my name is mrinal
```

Now you See the function gets Executed and prints the Expected Output  but for the varibale 'a' the output is undefined



**Explanation**
First is the memory allocation phase of the program, and initially all the variables are initialized with undefined values before program execution. In the memory allocation phase, a = undefined and fn printName() will be created and as you know in the memory allocation phase itself the whole function body is assigned . 


After that program execution phase will start, in which first the value of a is printed but still in this phase before the assignment of 4 can happen to the varaiable `a` we are trying to access it so the value is still undefined thats why the output for console.log(a) which is at the top is undefined , and  after the function is called, as function has the whole reference of it's body it gets executed as you would expect with it's output

hoisting is a behavior of the JS language through which declarations of functions, variables. etc can be moved to the top of their scope â€“ all before code execution

Great! We Now know what Hositing is, let's see another example but this time we will create a function as an expression


```javascript=
console.log(a)
printName()
var a = 4

function printName(){
    console.log('my name is mrinal')
}


let printAge = function(){
    console.log(24)
} // Function as Expression

printAge()
```

**Output**
```plaintext
undefined
my name is mrinal
24
```

Function as expression executes as it should , now , let's take it to the top


```javascript=
console.log(a)
printName()
printAge()
var a = 4

function printName(){
    console.log('my name is mrinal')
}
let printAge = function(){
    console.log(24)
}

```

But now this program will give an error that printAge is not defined. We are getting this error as we are working with function as expression and printAge does not have a function during initialization. It has an undefined value during initialization as it is variable for every varaible in the memory allocation phase undefined is assigned

**let**
```javascript=
console.log(a)
printName()
let a = 4

function printName(){
    console.log('my name is mrinal')
}
let printAge = function(){
    console.log(24)
}
printAge()
```

This program will give an error at line console.log(a) that `cannot access 'a' before initialization`. This is because let will first initialise your variable with temporal dead zone. Whenever a variable is created with the `let`, then that variable can not be accessed before initialisation means until the code execution phase is not started. Before code execution, it is in a temporal dead zone.

# Temporal dead zone(TDZ)
When you declare a variable with let or const, then these variables will not be accessible before their initialization and at this moment they will be in a temporal dead zone.
